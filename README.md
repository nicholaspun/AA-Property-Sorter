A small piece of code I did for a friend a while back. 

The "*aaprop_gen_script.py*" file takes in a text file of proteins (written using as a chain of amino acids), and produces a summary  of the amount of charged, polar and hydrophobic amino acids there are in the protein (for each one). 
The "*aminoacids.txt*" file shows a sample of randomly generated proteins (created using the "*gen_aminos.py*" file). 

For more information of what's going on, [this article]("http://www.proteinstructures.com/Structure/Structure/amino-acids.html") taken from *proteinstructures.com* was what I used as a guide. 

Cheers.
